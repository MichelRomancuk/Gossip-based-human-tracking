You will need your raspberry pi's loaded up with Raspberry Pi OS with desktop (since the lite version comes without all networking libraries.

```bash
sudo apt update
```
```bash
sudo apt install build-essential cmake
sudo apt install libgtk-3-dev
sudo apt install libboost-all-dev
```
```
pip3 install dlib
pip3 install skip√ºy
pip3 install scikit-image
